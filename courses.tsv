Extreme-Weather and Climate-Change Physics	ATOC 100	3	This course will provide an overview of extreme weather and climate phenomena, using calculus-based mathematical and physical principles. It will examine the physics and dynamics associated with extreme weather and climate phenomena, including blizzards, heat waves, cold waves, ice storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. The atmospheric and oceanic observing system will be used to quantify the structure and mechanisms of extreme weather and climate events. The physics of climate change will be interpreted through the natural and anthropogenic changes to Earth's radiation and energy balances. An introduction to climate models (both simple and complex) will illustrate the concepts of forcing, feedbacks, and climate sensitivity, and provide the foundation for understanding future changes in extreme weather.
